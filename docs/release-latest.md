We just released the latest version of the **[LaML app](https://web.lab-ml.com/home)**. It's **[open-source](https://github.com/lab-ml/app)** and I'm happy to share with the community.

If you are not familiar with **[LaML app](https://web.lab-ml.com/home)**, it's a tool to **monitor your ML model training progress**. Currently, we have a web version, that gives you a **great mobile experience** on a mobile browser.

In this latest release, we've added several new features that I like to highlight here:

* **Model Gradients, Activations and Parameters:** Now you can track and compare these indicators independently. We provide a separate analysis for each of the indicator types.
* **Summary and Detail Views:** Summary views would help you to quickly scan and understand your model progress. You can use detail views for more in-depth analysis.
* **Track only what you need:** You can pick and save the indicators that you want to track in the detail view. This would give you a customised summary view where you can focus on specific model indicators.

Here is a **[demo](https://web.lab-ml.com/run?run_uuid=df8ed3ba2ee711eb9640acde48001122)** if you are not already familiar with. **We love to hear your feedback and suggestions**. Thank you all and I appreciate the support.
